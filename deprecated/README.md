### Note about the deprecated folder

These objects have been removed from the release for various reasons, 
usually having been replaced by a more useful version of the same object. 
Actual deletion from the release is possible, but not likely. 
The objects here are well tested, and were at one point heavily used, 
however they are entirely unsupported now.

### Installation

To use these objects:
	you must manually add the dev folder to your search path. 
	While this is annoying, the act of doing it represents tacit 
	approval to use these with the knowledge that they are unsupported 
	and may be deleted at some point in the future.
