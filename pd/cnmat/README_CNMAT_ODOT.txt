README_ODOT

ODOT increases programmer productivity by enabling functional programming, object-oriented programming, template metaprogramming, delegation and other modern programming concepts in the context of Pd and Max/MSP/Jitter.

To install Pd version put the cnmat folder in your preferred search path, and import or declare to start using.*

*note: you may need to specify the full address using the [declare] method. For example if your cnmat folder is in the /Library/Pd folder, try: [declare -stdpath /Library/Pd/cnmat]. Also the [declare] method may not take effect until you reload the patch. The [import] method in Pd-extended works as expected.
