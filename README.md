CNMAT-odot
==========

The odot system augments dataflow languages like Max/MSP, PD and Node Red with the following:

1) The odot bundle aggregate data type, inspired by and currently encoded with OSC
2) An expression language supporting a diverse collection of ancient and modern programming paradigms including:
functional, declarative, imperative, dynamic, delegation-based objects, dynamic class-based objects, aspect-oriented
3) Timing and scheduling primitives to support sequencing and synchronization aspects of media and network programming.


Roadmap

odot has been used in various experimental incarnations for many years at CNMAT. The public release roadmap is:

1.0: for Max/MSP
2.0: for PD and Node Red, and  support for class-based objects
3.0: integral support for sound, graphics and imagery
