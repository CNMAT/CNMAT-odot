* Open Issues
** General
*** Get libo and libomax out of the odot folders.  some other objects depend on those libs, so we need
to be able to fork releases of them that are stable.
*** Not urgent, but the eval code in osc_expr.c needs to be separated from the function code.
** Bugs
*** o.expr
*** o.pack
**** BUG The set message should produce an error when the new address is a duplicate of an existing one
**** BUG The address '/' is invalid and should produce an error.  use the sanity check methods in osc_error
**** BUG Trailing slashes should be removed (eg, /foo/)
** Feature Requests
*** General
**** TODO Boolean values become signed 1-bit values: 00=0, 01=1, 11=-1
**** TODO Support for blobs
**** TODO Support for 16-bit floats (half float)
**** TODO Postfix type specifiers
**** TODO libo and libomax versions need to be reported.
**** TODO Explicit way to convert bundle to naked OSC message
**** STARTED objects that allow the creation of bundles should restrict them from having duplicate addresses [6/7]
- [X] o.collect
- [X] o.difference
- [X] o.intersection
- [ ] o.message
- [X] o.pack
- [X] o.pak
- [X] o.union
**** STARTED Implement error handler
this may be a lifelong project...
**** TODO Constants need to be checked for accuracy at all precisions
**** TODO All formatting code needs to be refactored
**** TODO udpsend encodes lists, floats and ints with addresses with no slashes
*** o.expr
**** TODO if() should be a special case of cond and we should have when and unless
**** WAITING Codebox
**** TODO settypetags() should work like the cast functions
**** STARTED add malformed rules to report errors for obvious malformed constructions
**** TODO implement compile-time argument type-checking.  this is most relevant with strings and a few functions
like bound() that need OSC addresses
**** TODO all functions that can't handle strings need to check for them and complain when they find them
**** TODO nth and assign_to_index should operate on strings as arrays
**** TODO sprintf()
**** TODO dolist and dotimes
**** TODO when a lexical environment is finished, any changes to variables in then enclosing environment
should persist
**** BUG value() needs to post an error if its argument (after evaluation if the arg is an expr) is not an address.
**** TODO support the '.' operator on the left side of an assignment
**** TODO let() (this is just syntatic sugar for (lambda...)
**** TODO arg check apply lambda
*** o.difference/intersection/union
**** TODO o.difference/intersection/union should take arguments that define a message
*** new objects
**** TODO o.typetages: outputs the typetags.
**** TODO o.append
** Design questions
*** The fact that o.route can output both bundles and Max data is a source of bugs.  Rewrite o.route?  
New objects with more explicit behavior.

* VERSION 1.1.4b
Released [2012-05-17 Thu]
** General
*** FIXED buffer overrun in osc_atom_s_getString()
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.expr
**** FIXED memory leak in eval()

* VERSION 1.1.3b
Released [2012-05-17 Thu]
** General
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.expr
**** FIXED scale() and clip() don't output floats when the input is an int but the rest of the args are floats
**** FIXED crash when an argument to a high order function fails to return a value
* VERSION 1.1.2b
Released [2012-05-16 Wed]
** General
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.expr
**** FIXED scale() is broken

* VERSION 1.1.1b
Released [2012-05-10 Thu]
** General
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.expr
**** FIXED anonymous functions now evaluate multiple expressions properly


* VERSION 1.1b
Released [2012-05-09 Wed]
** General
*** Much better support for strings, double-quotes, and meta characters in general.  Double and single quotes,
dollar signs, and backslashes are all meta characters that are interpreted by the parser.  Escaping
them now works properly.  These characters are escaped when displayed.
*** o.expr
**** DONE sort
**** DONE first() last() rest() butlast()
**** DONE join() 
**** Basic support for higher order apply() map() and reduce() functions that support anonymous (lambda) functions.
**** o.expr now supports the '.' operator for getting messages out of nested bundles (see below), but not
on the left side of an assignment operator.
**** DONE split()
*** o.flatten
**** New object flattens bundles with nested bundles.
*** o.route/select/atomize
**** added the '.' operator to selectors to represent nested bundles.  [o.route /foo./bar] means "get the
message with address /bar that's in a bundle in the data section of the message with address /foo"
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.message
**** FIXED typing a \ and clicking out of the box causes a crash
*** General
**** All objects have been rewritten to avoid the use of static types in the class_addmethod() functions 
due to a long standing bug with static types in Max.
*** o.collect
**** FIXED bug in the FullPacket routine when an incoming packet has an address that already exists
*** o.route
**** FIXED o.route (and friends) now protects against reentrancy properly.
*** o.expr
**** FIXED tokenize() is crashy
**** FIXED value() now works as expected.  it simply returns the data, if any, bound to an address if it exists.
If the argument to value() is an expression, that expression is evaluated and is expected to return 
an address which is then substituted for its data.  In previous versions, if the data associated
with an address was an address, the second address would be substituted for its data which was a bug.
**** FIXED scale() no longer returns NaN if min_out == max_out

* VERSION 1.0b
Released: [2012-03-06 Tue]
** General
*** DONE Verify that objects work with data sent from touchosc.
*** DONE reorganize directory structure for release.
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.message
**** FIXED a bug that would cause a crash when using $n substitutions with a bundle that 
was not typed into the mssage box (ie, one generated elsewhere and passed in via the right inlet).
*** o.cond
**** FIXED a bug that was freeing memory twice when the object was deleted from a patch
** Change Log
*** o.expr
**** DONE Change t_osc_expr_rec to support better documentation of function parameters
**** DONE o.expr documentation strings need to be available in max so you can build menus, etc.
**** DONE all operators should have functional equivalents
**** DONE map()
**** DONE value() (returns value associated with address)
**** DONE getaddresses() (returns a list of all addresses in the bundle)
**** DONE getmsgcount()
**** DONE the range() function that used to construct an arithmetic sequence is now called aseq().  
range() now computes the range of a list
*** o.message
**** DONE drawing has been made much more efficient--now comparable to the normal message box
*** patches
**** moved o.adsr~.maxpat into testing.  it needs more work to capture all the functionality of adsr~.
**** fixed a bug in the o.bcf2000 patch where an o.message with arguments $1 $2 was failing to parse its bundle
since $1 is not a valid osc address.  Replaced $1 with /$1 and then put a subpatch above it to remove 
the leading slash from the incoming address
**** moved o.countmessages to deprecated--use o.expr /count = msgcount() instead
**** added help file for o.countup.
**** added help file for o.delay.
**** added help file for o.insert.
**** added help file for o.date.
**** added help file for o.maxplatform.
**** fixed a bug in o.rename that would cause partial matches to become nested bundles.
**** moved o.template.factorial to testing.  there are a few bugs that need to be sorted out before this is released.
**** pulled old overview patches.

intended behavior and so doesn't post an error
* VERSION 1.0.9a
Released: [2012-01-18 Wed]

*** o.message
**** FIXED $n subs crashing 
$n subs weren't recognized if they had quotes around them.

* VERSION 1.0.7a
Released: [2012-01-15 Sun]

**** DONE After typing, o.message should read the contents of the text field, parse them, format them, and then place them back in the text field so that things like trailing decimals and quotes are displayed correctly.
**** FIXED o.message should display strings with quotes around them
