	<digest>
		Output a bundle containing the intersection of messages between two bundles

	<description>
		o.intersection takes two bundles and forms a new bundle that contains the OSC messages from the bundle received in the left inlet whose addresses are also present in the bundle received in the right inlet.

That is, if an address "/foo" is present in both the left-hand bundle and the right-hand bundle, it will be included in the resulting bundle. If "/foo" is present in either the left or the right hand bundle but not in the other, it will not be included in the result.
