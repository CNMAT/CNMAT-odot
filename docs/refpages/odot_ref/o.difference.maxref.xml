That is, if an address "/foo" is present in both the left-hand bundle and the right-hand bundle, it will not be included in the resulting bundle. If "/foo" is present in either the left or the right hand bundle but not in the other, it will be included in the result.

		o.difference takes the addresses of the bundles passed to its right and left outlets and produces a bundle containing addresses that are not present in both of them.
