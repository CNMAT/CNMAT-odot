If you are reading this, you are running Max 5 on OSX 10.4.10 or below. Unfortunately, due to bugs in Apple's web browser support in these versions of the operating system, the Max 5 in-application documentation won't display properly.</p>

<p>
We recommend updating to <a href="max:launch_browser/http:%2F%2Fdocs.info.apple.com%2Farticle.html?artnum=306297">OSX 10.4.11</a> and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
