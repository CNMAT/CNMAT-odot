# o.expr NODE
## Node Module

### Building

Dependencies not packaged with the release:

* `node-gyp` - use `% npm install node-gyp` if missing
* `node` and `v8`

This module depends on the `libo` library from CNMAT. The binary `libo.a` is included in `/lib` and the necessary headers are in `/include`. Please note that the `bindings.gyp` assumes that `libo.a` is in `/usr/local/lib/`.

To Build:

```
% node-gyp configure build
```

### Test

The test is lazily implemented, needs to change:

```
% node o_expr_test.js
```

You will need to send OSC-bundles to NODE yourself. (Max or pure data are probably easiest -- Max file is included.)

### Using

```
var o = require('./build/Release/odot'); // will be configured to live in node_modules ASAP
var expr = new o.expr();
expr.set("/result = /foo + /bar;");
var node_buffer = expr.eval(node_buffer_osc_bundle);
```

Note that you may set the expression in the constructor:

```
var o = require('./build/Release/odot');
var expr = new o.expr("/result = sin(/foo);");
```

### Node-Red Support

COMING SOON!
