					<h1>Leap User Experience Guidelines  </h1>

<p>The following user experience guidelines comprise our recommendations to<br/>
ensure that your Leap-enabled application is easy to learn and use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep in mind that symbology can be difficult to learn and memorize.</p>

<p><em>Avoid forcing users to learn complex hand gestures to interact with<br/>
your application.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Instead, draw inspiration from physical interaction and real-world<br/>
behaviors.</p>

<p><em>The more physically inspired interactions are, the less training a<br/>
person needs and the more intuitive and natural your application<br/>
feels.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t feel constrained by the limitations or inconveniences of the<br/>
real-world — this is your world.</p>

<p><em>Interaction doesn&rsquo;t have to be the way it has always been. It can<br/>
be any way we imagine it to be. Why force the user to reach all the<br/>
way out and grab an object? Why not have the object reach back? —<br/>
Give them “the force”!</em></p></li>
<li><p>The user should feel as if their intent is amplified rather than<br/>
subdued or masked.</p>

<p><em>For example, users often like their movements to be amplified when<br/>
using a mouse (i.e. they don&rsquo;t need 10 inches of mouse movement to<br/>
move 10 inches on screen). For gestural interactions, amplifying or<br/>
exaggerating responses can have an even more positive result. Keep<br/>
in mind that some people are more sensitive than others, so link<br/>
this exaggeration to a sensitivity setting for users to modify this<br/>
effect to their preference.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Concentrate on giving the user dynamic feedback to their actions.<br/>
The more feedback they have, the more precisely they can interact<br/>
with your software.</p>

<p><em>For example, the user will need to know when they are “pushing” a<br/>
button, but can be more effective if they can see when they are<br/>
hovering over a button, or how much they are pressing it.</em></p></li>
<li><p>On screen visuals (such as representations of hands, tools, or<br/>
digital feedback) should be simple, functional, and non-intrusive.</p>

<p><em>The user should not be distracted from the task by their tools or<br/>
environment. Decoration should not distract from your purpose.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Require more deliberate action for destructive or non-reversible<br/>
acts than for harmless ones.</p>

<p><em>Subtle gestures should be reserved for subtle actions. Conversely,<br/>
an act such as closing an application or deleting a file can be a<br/>
non-reversible event requiring a more deliberate action. Double<br/>
check with the user when unsure, such as a prompt for confirmation.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Provide a clear delineation and specific sense of modality between<br/>
acts of navigation and interaction, unless both are simple or one is<br/>
handled automatically (or with assistance). Mixing the two in a<br/>
complex situation can lead to confusion or disorientation.</p>

<p><em>For example, moving an object while having the user simultaneously<br/>
position their viewing angle inside a 3D environment is inherently<br/>
difficult. However, if the viewing angle moves automatically in<br/>
response to the user&rsquo;s movement, then working with the object is<br/>
easier. Likewise, when navigating a large data set the user will<br/>
want the view to move easily, but when highlighting a portion of the<br/>
data the view should remain still.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Overall, imagine that your user is faced with no instructions or<br/>
tutorials on how to use your application.</p>

<p><em>Strive at all costs to make their first intuitive guesses the right<br/>
ones. Where appropriate, create more than one proper way to do<br/>
something.</em></p></li>
</ul>
