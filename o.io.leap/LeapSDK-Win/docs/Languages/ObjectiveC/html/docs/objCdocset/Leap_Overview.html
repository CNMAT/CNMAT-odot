					<h1>Leap Overview  </h1>

<p>The Leap detects and tracks hands, fingers and finger-like tools. The<br/>
device operates in an intimate proximity with high precision and<br/>
tracking frame rate.</p>

<p>The Leap software analyzes the objects observed in the device field of<br/>
view. It recognizes hands, fingers, and tools, reporting both discrete<br/>
positions, gestures, and motion. The Leap field of view is an inverted<br/>
pyramid centered on the device. The effective range of the Leap extends<br/>
from approximately 25 to 600 millimeters above the device (1 inch to 2<br/>
feet).</p>

<h2>Coordinate system  </h2>

<p>The Leap employs a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. Values<br/>
reported are in units of real-world millimeters. The origin is centered<br/>
at the center of the Leap Motion Controller. The x- and z-axes lie in the<br/>
horizontal plane, with the x-axis running parallel to the long edge of<br/>
the device. The y-axis is vertical, with positive values increasing<br/>
upwards (in contrast to the downward orientation of most computer<br/>
graphics coordinate systems). The z-axis has positive values increasing<br/>
away from the computer screen.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Axes.png" alt="The Leap right-handed coordinate system." /></p>

<h2>Motion tracking data  </h2>

<p>As the Leap tracks hands, fingers, and tools in its field of view, it<br/>
provides updates as a set, or frame, of data. Each frame contains lists<br/>
of the basic tracking data, such as hands, fingers, and tools, as well<br/>
as recognized gestures and factors describing the overall motion in the<br/>
scene.</p>

<p>When it detects a hand, finger, tool, or gesture, the Leap assigns it a<br/>
unique ID designator. The ID remains the same as long as that entity<br/>
remains visible within the device&rsquo;s field of view. If tracking is lost<br/>
and regained, the Leap may assign a new ID (the software may not know<br/>
that the hand or finger is the same as the one visible earlier).</p>

<h3>Frames</h3>

<p>A <a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html">LeapFrame</a> object provides lists of the tracking data, gestures, and<br/>
factors describing the overall motion observed in the Leap field of<br/>
view.</p>

<h4>Lists of tracking data</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/hands">[LeapFrame hands]</a> — All hands.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/pointables">[LeapFrame pointables]</a> — All fingers and tools as <a href="../../Classes/LeapPointable.html">LeapPointable</a> objects.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/fingers">[LeapFrame fingers]</a> — All the fingers.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/tools">[LeapFrame tools]</a> — All the tools.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/gestures:">[LeapFrame gestures:]</a> — All the gestures that started, ended, or which had an<br/>
update.</li>
</ul>


<p>The three pointables lists (<code>Pointables</code>, <code>Fingers</code>, and <code>Tools</code>)<br/>
contain every pointable object detected in a frame. You can access the<br/>
pointables associated with a hand through the LeapHand objects in the list<br/>
of hands. Note that a finger or tool may not be associated with a hand<br/>
if the user&rsquo;s hand is only partially within the Leap field of view.</p>

<p>If you are tracking an individual object, such as a finger, from frame<br/>
to frame, you can use the ID associated with that object to look it up<br/>
in each new frame. Use the following functions to look up specific<br/>
object types by ID:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/hand:">[LeapFrame hand:]</a></li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/finger:">[LeapFrame finger:]</a></li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/tool:">[LeapFrame tool:]</a></li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/pointable:">[LeapFrame pointable:]</a></li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/gesture:">[LeapFrame gesture:]</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These functions return a reference to the corresponding object if it<br/>
exists in the current frame. If the object no longer exists, then a<br/>
special invalid object is returned. Invalid objects are well-defined,<br/>
but do not contain valid tracking data. This technique helps reduce the<br/>
amount of null checking you have to do to when accessing Leap tracking<br/>
data.</p>

<h4>Frame motion</h4>

<p>The Leap analyzes the overall motion which occurred since an earlier<br/>
frame and synthesizes representative translation, rotation, and scale<br/>
factors. For example, if you move both hands to the left in the Leap<br/>
field of view the frame contains translation. If you twist your hands as<br/>
if turning a ball, the frame contains rotation. If you move your hands<br/>
towards or away from each other, the frame contains scaling. The Leap<br/>
uses all of the objects within the field of view when analyzing motion.<br/>
If it only detects one hand, then the Leap bases the frame motion<br/>
factors on the movement of that hand. If it detects two hands, then the<br/>
Leap bases the frame motion factors on the movement of both hands<br/>
together. You can also get independent motion factors for each hand from<br/>
a LeapHand object.</p>

<p>Frame motions are derived by comparing the current frame with a<br/>
specified earlier frame. The attributes describing the synthesized<br/>
motion include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/rotationAxis:">[LeapFrame rotationAxis:]</a> — A direction vector expressing the axis of rotation.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/rotationAngle:">[LeapFrame rotationAngle:]</a> — The angle of rotation clockwise around the<br/>
rotation axis (using the right-hand rule).</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/rotationMatrix:">[LeapFrame rotationMatrix:]</a> — A transform matrix expressing the rotation.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/scaleFactor:">[LeapFrame scaleFactor:]</a> — A factor expressing expansion or contraction.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/translation:">[LeapFrame translation:]</a> — A vector expressing the linear movement.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can apply the motion factors to manipulate objects in your<br/>
application&rsquo;s scene without having to track individual hands and fingers<br/>
over multiple frames.</p>

<h3>Hand model</h3>

<p>The hand model provides information about the position, characteristics,<br/>
and movement of a detected hand as well as lists of the fingers and<br/>
tools associated with the hand.</p>

<p>The Leap API provides as much information about a hand as possible.<br/>
However, the Leap may not be able to determine all hand attributes in<br/>
every frame. For example, when a hand is clenched into a fist, its<br/>
fingers are not visible to the Leap so the finger list will be empty.<br/>
Your code should handle the cases where an attribute in the model is not<br/>
available.</p>

<p>The Leap does not determine whether a hand is a left or right hand. More<br/>
than two hands can appear in the hand list for a frame if more than one<br/>
person&rsquo;s hands or other hand-like objects are in view. However, we<br/>
recommend keeping at most two hands in the Leap Motion Controller&rsquo;s field <br/>
of view for optimal motion tracking quality.</p>

<h4>Hand attributes</h4>

<p>The LeapHand object provides several attributes reporting the physical<br/>
characteristics of a detected hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>[LeapHand palmPosition] — The center of the palm measured in millimeters from<br/>
the Leap origin.</li>
<li>[LeapHand palmVelocity] — The speed of the palm in millimeters per second.</li>
<li>[LeapHand palmNormal] — A vector perpendicular to the plane formed by the<br/>
palm of the hand. The vector points downward out of the palm.</li>
<li>[LeapHand direction] — A vector pointing from the center of the palm toward<br/>
the fingers.</li>
<li>[LeapHand sphereCenter] — The center of a sphere fit to the curvature of the<br/>
hand (as if it were holding a ball).</li>
<li>[LeapHand sphereRadius] — The radius of a sphere fit to the curvature of the<br/>
hand. The radius changes with the shape of the hand.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>direction</code> and <code>palmNormal</code> members are unit direction vectors describing<br/>
the orientation of the hand with respect to the Leap coordinate system.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Palm_Vectors.png" alt="The normal vector points perpendicularly out of the hand; the  
direction vector points forward." /></p>

<p>The <code>sphereCenter</code> and <code>sphereRadius</code> members describe a sphere that is placed<br/>
and sized to fit into the curvature of the hand:</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Hand_Ball.png" alt="The size of the sphere decreases as the fingers are  
curled." /></p>

<h4>Hand motion</h4>

<p>The LeapHand object also provides several attributes reporting the motion of<br/>
a detected hand between frames. The Leap analyzes the motion of the<br/>
hand, as well as its associated fingers and tools and reports<br/>
representative translation, rotation, and scale factors. Moving your<br/>
hand around the Leap field of view produces translation. Turning,<br/>
twisting, or tilting your hand produces rotation. Moving fingers or<br/>
tools toward or away from each other produces scaling.</p>

<p>Hand motions are derived by comparing the characteristics of the hand in<br/>
the current frame to those in a specified earlier frame. The attributes<br/>
describing the synthesized motion include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/rotationAxis:">[LeapHand rotationAxis:]</a> — A direction vector expressing the axis of rotation.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/rotationAngle:">[LeapHand rotationAngle:]</a> — The angle of rotation clockwise around the<br/>
rotation axis (using the right-hand rule).</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/rotationMatrix:">[LeapHand rotationMatrix:]</a> — A transform matrix expressing the rotation.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/scaleFactor:">[LeapHand scaleFactor:]</a> — A factor expressing expansion or contraction.</li>
<li><a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/translation:">[LeapHand translation:]</a> — A vector expressing the linear movement.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Finger and Tool lists</h4>

<p>You can access the fingers and tools associated with a hand using one of<br/>
three lists:</p>

<ul>
<li>[LeapHand pointables] — Both fingers and tools as <code>Pointable</code> objects.</li>
<li>[LeapHand fingers] — Just the fingers.</li>
<li>[LeapHand tools] — Just the tools.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also find an individual finger or tool using an ID value<br/>
obtained in a previous frame. Use the <a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/finger:">[LeapHand finger:]</a>, the<br/>
<a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/tool:">[LeapHand tool:]</a>, or, if you don&rsquo;t need to distinguish between fingers and<br/>
tools, the <a href="../../Classes/LeapHand.html#//api/name/pointable:">[LeapHand pointable:]</a> function. These functions return a<br/>
reference to the corresponding object in the current frame if it exists.<br/>
If a finger or tool is not associated with the hand in this frame, then<br/>
an invalid object is returned.</p>

<h3>Finger and Tool models</h3>

<p>The Leap detects and tracks both fingers and tools within its field of<br/>
view. The Leap classifies finger-like objects according to shape. A tool<br/>
is longer, thinner, and straighter than a finger.</p>

<p>In the Leap model, the physical characteristics of fingers and tools are<br/>
abstracted into a <code>LeapPointable</code> object. Fingers and tools are types of<br/>
pointable objects. The physical characteristics of pointable objects<br/>
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>[LeapPointable length] — The length of the visible portion of the object (from<br/>
where it extends out of the hand to the tip).</li>
<li>[LeapPointable width] — The average width of the visible portion of the object.</li>
<li>[LeapPointable direction] — A unit direction vector pointing in the same direction<br/>
as the object (i.e. from base to tip).</li>
<li>[LeapPointable tipPosition] — The position of the tip in millimeters from the Leap<br/>
origin.</li>
<li>[LeapPointable tipVelocity] — The speed of the tip in millimeters per second.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Finger_Model.png" alt="LeapFinger `tipPosition` and `direction` vectors provide the positions of  
the finger tips and the directions in which the fingers are  
pointing." /></p>

<p>The Leap classifies a detected pointable object as either a finger or a<br/>
tool. Use the [LeapPointable isTool] function to determine which one a<br/>
LeapPointable object represents.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Tool.png" alt="A tool is longer, thinner, and straighter than a  
finger." /></p>

<h3>Gestures</h3>

<p>The Leap recognizes certain movement patterns as gestures which could<br/>
indicate a user intent or command. The Leap reports gestures observed in<br/>
a frame the in the same way that it reports other motion tracking data<br/>
like fingers and hands. For each gesture observed, the Leap adds a<br/>
<a href="../../Classes/LeapGesture.html">LeapGesture</a> object to the frame. You can get these <code>LeapGesture</code> objects from the<br/>
<a href="../../Classes/LeapFrame.html#//api/name/gestures:">[LeapFrame gestures:]</a> list.</p>

<blockquote><p>The following movement patterns are recognized by the Leap:</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Circle — A single finger tracing a circle.</li>
<li>Swipe — A linear movement of the hand.</li>
<li>Key Tap — A tapping movement by a finger as if tapping a keyboard<br/>
key.</li>
<li>Screen Tap — A tapping movement by the finger as if tapping a<br/>
vertical computer screen.</li>
</ul>


<p>When the Leap first classifies a movement pattern as a gesture, it adds<br/>
a LeapGesture object to the frame. If the gesture continues over time, the<br/>
Leap adds updated LeapGesture objects to subsequent frame. <br/>
Circle and swipe gestures are continuous. The Leap updates the progress of these<br/>
gestures each frame. Taps are discrete gestures. The Leap reports each<br/>
tap with a single LeapGesture object.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> before using gestures in your application, you must<br/>
enable recognition for each gesture you intend to use with the <br/>
<a href="../../Classes/LeapController.html#//api/name/enableGesture:enable:">[LeapController enableGesture:enable:]</a>.</p>

<h4>Circle</h4>

<p>The Leap recognizes the motion of a finger tracing a circle in space as<br/>
a <em>Circle</em> gesture.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Gesture_Circle.png" alt="A circle gesture with the forefinger." /></p>

<p>You can make a circle with any finger or tool. Circle gestures are<br/>
continuous. Once the gesture starts, the Leap will update the progress<br/>
until the gesture ends. A circle gesture ends when the circling finger<br/>
or tool departs from the circle locus or moves too slow.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../Classes/LeapCircleGesture.html">LeapCircleGesture</a> in the API reference for more information.</p>

<h4>Swipe</h4>

<p>The Leap recognizes a linear movement of a finger as a <em>Swipe</em> gesture.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Gesture_Swipe.png" alt="A horizontal swipe gesture." /></p>

<p>You can make a swipe gesture with any finger and in any direction. Swipe<br/>
gestures are continuous. Once the gesture starts, the Leap will update<br/>
the progress until the gesture ends. A swipe gesture ends when the<br/>
finger changes directions or moves too slow.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../Classes/LeapSwipeGesture.html">LeapSwipeGesture</a> in the API reference for more information.</p>

<h4>Taps</h4>

<p>The Leap recognizes two types of taps: the downward <em>Key Tap</em> and the<br/>
forward <em>Screen Tap</em>.</p>

<h3>Key Taps</h3>

<p>The Leap recognizes a quick, downward tapping movement by a finger or<br/>
tool as a <em>Key Tap</em> gesture.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Gesture_Tap.png" alt="A key tap gesture with the forefinger." /></p>

<p>You can make a key tap gesture by tapping downward as if pressing a<br/>
piano key. Tap gestures are discrete. Only a single LeapGesture object is<br/>
added per tap gesture.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../Classes/LeapKeyTapGesture.html">LeapKeyTapGesture</a> in the API reference for more information.</p>

<h3>Screen Taps</h3>

<p>The Leap recognizes a quick, forward tapping movement by a finger or<br/>
tool as a <em>Screen Tap</em> gesture.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Gesture_Tap2.png" alt="A screen tap gesture with the  
forefinger." /></p>

<p>You can make a key tap gesture by tapping or pushing foward in space as<br/>
if touching a vertical touch screen. Tap gestures are discrete. Only a<br/>
single Gesture object is added per tap gesture.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../Classes/LeapScreenTapGesture.html">LeapScreenTapGesture</a> in the API reference for more information.</p>
