<dd><p>The Screen class represents a computer monitor screen.</p>
<p>The Screen class reports characteristics describing the position and
orientation of the monitor screen within the Leap Motion coordinate system. These
characteristics include the bottom-left corner position of the screen,
direction vectors for the horizontal and vertical axes of the screen, and
the screen&#8217;s normal vector. The screen must be properly registered with the
Screen Locator for the Leap Motion software to report these characteristics accurately.
The Screen class also reports the size of the screen in pixels, using
information obtained from the operating system. (Run the Screen Locator
from the Leap Motion Settings dialog, on the Screen page.)</p>
<p>You can get the point of intersection between the screen and a ray
projected from a Pointable object using the Screen::intersect() function.
Likewise, you can get the closest point on the screen to a point in space
using the Screen::project() function. Again, the screen location
must be registered with the Screen Locator for these functions to
return accurate values.</p>
<p>Note that Screen objects can be invalid, which means that they do not contain
valid screen coordinate data and do not correspond to a physical entity.
Test for validity with the Screen::isValid() function.</p>

<dd><p>Returns the intersection between this screen and a ray projecting from a
Pointable object.</p>
<p>The projected ray emanates from the Pointable tipPosition along the
Pointable&#8217;s direction vector.</p>
<p>Set the normalize parameter to true to request the intersection point in
normalized screen coordinates. Normalized screen coordinates are usually
values between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the screen&#8217;s origin at the
bottom-left corner and 1 represents the opposite edge (either top or
right). When you request normalized coordinates, the z-component of the
returned vector is zero. Multiply a normalized coordinate by the values
returned by Screen::widthPixels() or Screen::heightPixels() to calculate
the screen position in pixels (remembering that many other computer
graphics coordinate systems place the origin in the top-left corner).</p>
<p>Set the normalize parameter to false to request the intersection point
in Leap Motion coordinates (millimeters from the Leap Motion origin).</p>
<p>If the Pointable object points outside the screen&#8217;s border (but still
intersects the plane in which the screen lies), the returned intersection
point is clamped to the nearest point on the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>You can use the clampRatio parameter to contract or expand the area in
which you can point. For example, if you set the clampRatio parameter to
0.5, then the positions reported for intersection points outside the
central 50% of the screen are moved to the border of this smaller area.
If, on the other hand, you expanded the area by setting clampRatio to
a value such as 3.0, then you could point well outside screen&#8217;s physical
boundary before the intersection points would be clamped. The positions
for any points clamped would also be placed on this larger outer border.
The positions reported for any intersection points inside the clamping
border are unaffected by clamping.</p>
<pre>        normalizedCoordinates = screen.intersect(pointable, True, 0.5)
</pre><p>If the Pointable object does not point toward the plane of the screen
(i.e. it is pointing parallel to or away from the screen), then the
components of the returned vector are all set to NaN (not-a-number).</p>
